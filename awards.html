        <h5>November-December, 2017</h5>
        <p class="desc">For this project, I used Python to implement a fully functional interpreter for the Scheme programming 
          language. I used a read-evaluate-print loop to lex, parse and interprete user input. My interpretor supported tail recursion and 
          macros. I wrote extensive unit tests to verify the correctness of my implementation.

        <p class="desc">For this project, I implemented the logic for a tower defense game using Python. I implemented multiple 
          tower classes and enemy classes, including long ranged towers, short range towers, armored towers, and debuff towers.
          I was provided with a graphical user interface to accompany the game.

        <img src="./images/map.jpg" class="center" alt="A picture of the map" style="width:100%;" />
        <p class="desc">For this project, I used the Python and the Yelp academic dataset to model restaraunts around Berkeley, using their 
          names, locations, categories, prices, and reviews. I then implemented a Yelp-powered restaraunt recommedation program. 
          The program takes a user's location, and returns a centroid corresponding to the cluster of retaraunts nearest to the user's 
          position. I used a k-means algorithim to group restaraunts into clusters. From this cluster, I then used machine
          learning techniques to predict ratings for the unrated restaraunts based on the user's previous ratings. For the area 
          closest to each centroid, I assigned a color based on the average rating for the restarunts in the cluster, and used 
          this to create a voronoi diagram.

        <h5>October, 2017</h5>
        <img src="./images/hog.jpg" class="center" alt="A picture of hog interface" style="width:100%;"/>
        <p class="desc">For this project, I worked to implement a simulator for a more complex cersion of the popular dice game Hog.
          I used Python to create a dice function that could simulate dice rolls. I then wrote a takeTurn function that could take 
          a set of dice, game state, and strategy, and then make a play accordingly. Functions were added as needed so that human players 
          could play against the computer, the computer could play against the computer, and players could play against eachother.
          The simulator provided commentary during games. I was provided with a basic framework and graphical interface to use in 
          my program. I used my simulation to design, test, and develop different strategies for my Hog game.</p>

        <h5>July-August, 2016</h5>
        <img src="./images/virtualmuseum.jpg" class="center" alt="A picture of virtual museum" style="width:100%;" />
        <p class="desc">This project was my first major computer science project. I stayed at UCI for a month as part of the COSMOS (California State 
          Academy for Math and Science) program. I was part of a 4 member team of high school students tasked with creating an application
          that could incorporate 3D sound. Essentially, 3D sound allows for the specific placement of sounds within a 3D scene, which can 
          add realism to virtual spaces. Our team decided to develop a virtual museum application, so that people without physical access to 
          traditional  museums could instead explore them from their mobile devices. As part of the project, I designed 3D exhibit models
          and placed them within a 3D scene using Apple's 3D Scenekit. Our app allowed for users to navigate between exhibits and listen to 
          recorded scripts about each exhibit. The 3D sound scene responded to viewing angle using simple linear panning techniques.
          The project was coded primarily in Swift 2.2 using Xcode, though we also used sound editing software and 3D modeling software.
