        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a freshman studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
            Currently, I am exploring summer internship opportunities. I am interested in autonomous
            vehicle controls, rocket technology, and machine learning. When I am not busy with school,
            I enjoy reading science fiction and working on projects. You can see some of my work on 
            <a href="https://github.com/gkliger" target="_blank">Github</a>, but the vast majority
            is stored on a private repository.
        </p>
        <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In the summer of 2017, I worked as a STEM teacher at public schools in Irvine. I worked full time and taught 6th graders 
              how to program VEX and MindStorm robots. I also taught my students how to use 3D modeling software to create 
              3D printed objects, and the basics of cirucit design. I gained experience in communication and explaining 
              complicated topics. It was very rewarding to help others.</li>
            <li>In the summer fo 2016, I was part of the COSMOS (California State Academy for Math and Science) program at UCI.
              I worked with a team of three other high school students to design and develop a virtual museum iOS application.
              We used Apple's 3D Scene Kit to create a 3D room filled with interactive museum exhibits. Professor Martin Jaroszewicz
              helped us to add 3D sounds to our application. I gained valuable experience working with a small team to 
              meet deadlines and develop a large and complex application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I want to intern for a company that will push me to influence the future. Whether that means working in the 
            rocket industry, automobile industry, or some other sphere, I know that I will contribute insight and creativity
            towards meeting the challenges posed.

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano and clarinet and attending music concerts at Berkeley. I am also 
          involved in several on campus groups. I am an active member of Berkeley IEEE and served as a Web Officer for 
          the organization. I am also a member of HKN, Berkeley's EECS Honor Society, which organizes on campus events.
